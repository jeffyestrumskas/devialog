* Is a behavior/anomaly/signature-based syslog intrusion detection system
* Detects new unknown attacks via anomalies in syslog
* Fits comfortably in heterogeneous Unix/Linux/BSD environments at the core of a central syslog server
* Generates its own signatures
* Can email anomalies with included generated signatures in to administrators to ignore future similar events
